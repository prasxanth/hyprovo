# hyprovo
**hyprovo** is a minimal (~160 LOC) testing framework for [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy) heavily inspired by the chapter on [Practical: Building a Unit Test Framework](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-building-a-unit-test-framework.html) in [Practical Common Lisp](https://gigamonkeys.com/book/).

> provo (Esperanto) â‡” test (English)
